# QuickCert

Developed at MLH Local Build hackathon 2019 organized by JS Lovers Delhi, QuickCert is a service to automate the generation and distribution of certificates. Our MVP for the hackathon was built around the specific usecase of a coach using the service to generate certificates for the results of a sports meet.
